This is the experimental code for the following paper:

	* H.-F. Yu, N. Rao, and I. S. Dhillon. Temporal Regularized 
	  Matrix Factoriztion for High-dimensional Time Series Prediction. Advances 
      in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 29, 2016.

Interfaces
==========
The core codes of TRMF are implemented in C++. The original experiments are done using a Matlab interface. 
Upon the requests, I refactored the core C++ codes and created an easy-to-use Python interface (with Scipy/Numpy).
